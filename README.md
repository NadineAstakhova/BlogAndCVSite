# Personal site with cv and portfolio

<p>Web application based on the MVC-model using the PHP-framework Yii2 (advanced template). Besides using JS, HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap.

<p>The site has two languages (Russian and English). Also there are multilanguage cv and portfolio articles.

<p>In future I want to add blog and admin panel.
